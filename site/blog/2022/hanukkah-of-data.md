Hey everyone!

If you like the concept of [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com), but wish there was set of data puzzles for data nerds, well, this year you're in luck!

We've been hard at work the past couple of months creating [Hanukkah of Data](https://hanukkah.bluebird.sh), a holiday puzzle hunt, with 8 days of bite-sized data puzzles.
Starting December 18th, we'll be releasing one puzzle a day, over the 8 days of Hanukkah.

This is your chance to explore a fictional dataset with SQL or [VisiData](https://visidata.org) or [Datasette](https://datasette.io/) or your favorite data analysis tool, to help Aunt Sarah find the family holiday tapestry before her father notices it's missing!

[Register here](https://hanukkah.bluebird.sh/register) to receive notifications when puzzles become available.

Thanks to @frosencrantz for creating [this well-timed discussion comment](https://github.com/saulpw/visidata/discussions/1221#discussioncomment-4013685) that inspired us.

Happy holidays from Saul and the rest of the devottys!
