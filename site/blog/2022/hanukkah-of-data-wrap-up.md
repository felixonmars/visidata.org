Hanukkah of Data has come to an end. We hope you enjoyed the eight nights of puzzles!

I’ve been so happy to see people sharing about their experiences, such as these posts:

- “[Thoughts on Hanukkah of Data 2022](https://www.georgeho.org/hanukkah-of-data-2022/)” by George Ho
- “[hanukkah of data 2022/5783](https://di.nmfay.com/hanukkah)” by Dian Fay
- “[Hanukkah of Data 2022](https://civilstat.com/2022/12/hanukkah-of-data-2022/)” by Jerzy Wieczorek
- [The #HanukkahOfData tag on Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/tags/HanukkahOfData)

I’d love to hear about your experience, particularly if you played most of the puzzles.

Drop by [bluebird.sh/chat](https://bluebird.sh/chat) and let us know your favorite (and least favorite!) puzzles.

## Puzzling Visitors

Here are how many visits each puzzle page had the past eight days (approximately during Hanukkah).

(SAUL CAN YOU HELP ME INTERPRET THE GOATCOUNTER NUMBERS HERE? LOOKING AT THE URLS, SOMEHOW I HAVE )

1st — 1,929
2nd — 994
3rd — 532
4th — 335
5th — 331
6th — 158
7th — 144
8th — 109
9th — 67
10th - 43

(ONCE THE COUNTS ABOVE ARE CORRECT, I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE FUN TO ADD % CHANGE FROM PUZZLE TO PUZZLE --- e.g. of people who attempted puzzle #6, 91% completed and moved on to #7...  not strictly accurate but maybe just maybe???)

## What’s next?

Hanukkah 5783 may be over, but:

- the puzzles will stay up
- the dataset used may change (and thus any solutions may change)
- you can still share [hanukkah.bluebird.sh](https://hanukkah.bluebird.sh/credits/) with others (please do!)
- unlike during the holiday, any new puzzlers won’t have to wait 24 hours to proceed to the next puzzle; simply completing one puzzle will unlock the next puzzle
- the puzzles are quite hackable, by design (we invite you to poke around using your JS console)
